        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is a Python library used for fast numerical computing. It provides powerful multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions. It‚Äôs widely used because it makes calculations faster and easier than using normal Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        "Broadcasting lets NumPy perform operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding smaller arrays to match larger ones ‚Äî without making extra copies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "\n",
        "A DataFrame is a 2D table of data with labeled rows and columns, like an Excel sheet. It‚Äôs used for storing and analyzing structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "groupby() groups data based on one or more columns and allows you to apply functions like sum, mean, or count to each group separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Seaborn makes it easy to create attractive and informative charts. It‚Äôs built on Matplotlib and is great for showing data relationships and patterns with less code.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays are faster, store one data type, and support math operations directly. Python lists are slower, can hold mixed data, and need loops for math.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",
        "\n",
        "A heatmap shows data values as colors in a grid. It‚Äôs used to spot patterns or correlations in large datasets, like a correlation matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What does ‚Äúvectorized operation‚Äù mean in NumPy?\n",
        "\n",
        "It means performing calculations on entire arrays at once instead of using loops, making the code faster and shorter.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n",
        "\n",
        "Matplotlib makes static (non-interactive) plots. Plotly makes interactive, web-based charts that you can zoom or hover over.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas:\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows multiple levels of indexing (like country ‚Üí year) so you can easily handle and analyze complex, multi-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Role of Seaborn‚Äôs pairplot() function:\n",
        "\n",
        "pairplot() shows relationships between all pairs of variables in one chart using scatter plots and histograms ‚Äî great for exploring data.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Purpose of the describe() function in Pandas:\n",
        "\n",
        "It gives quick summary statistics (count, mean, min, max, etc.) of numeric columns in a DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing data can lead to wrong results. Handling it ensures your analysis is correct and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Benefits of using Plotly for visualization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Plotly creates interactive, beautiful, and web-ready charts easily. It‚Äôs great for dashboards and data exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy stores data in n-dimensional arrays (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.) and allows easy slicing, reshaping, and operations across dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Role of Bokeh in data visualization:\n",
        "Bokeh helps build interactive, real-time charts and dashboards for the web using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas:\n",
        "\n",
        "map() is used to apply a function element-wise to a Series.\n",
        "\n",
        "apply() can be used on both DataFrame and Series to apply a function along rows or columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "üìò Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "df['col'].map(str.upper)      # Works on Series\n",
        "df.apply(sum, axis=0)         # Works on DataFrame\n",
